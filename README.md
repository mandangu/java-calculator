## Getting Started with VS Code

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here's how to get started writing and running Java code in Visual Studio Code.

### 📁 Folder Structure

The workspace contains the following folders:

- `src/` – where your Java source code lives (e.g. `Calculate.java`)
- `lib/` – for managing external dependencies
- `bin/` – generated automatically when you compile your code

> You can change this structure by updating `.vscode/settings.json`.
